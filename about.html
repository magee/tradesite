        <h4>History</h4>

        <p>Established in 1985, I originally started my business back in the 80's (formerly Gleason Plumbing) and worked into full time business in the early 90's. I have always offered free estimates and always give senior discounts. I love helping the customer especially with uncommon problems. </p>
        <p>I don't always believe in repairing the same old problem, sometimes new is just better. I have many years of experience working for a local sewer treatment plant so I believe that provides me with the most knowledgeable experience when it comes to diagnosing and replacing sewer lines. We also have the capability of video-taping and locating sewer lines. We offer complete service and repairs, new installations, sewer and drain cleaning, sewer line locating and video-taping.</p>

        <p>We are not a franchise - we are a small family owned and operated company who completely believes in 100% customer satisfaction. We are also a member of the BBB. </p>
